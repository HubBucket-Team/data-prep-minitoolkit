# data-prep-minitoolkit

Three little python scripts for data preparation: remove commas, add commas, concatenate file.

## Commatizer

This script replaces characters you specify with commas.

## Decommatizer 

This script removes commas in files you specfiy. (This is helpful if you want to turn a tab-seperated .csv into a comma-sperated .csv but want to get rid of commas in text fields first.)

## FileCat

This script pastes together files you specify.
