# data-prep-minitoolkit

Three little python scripts for data preparation: remove commas, add commas, and concatenate multiple files into one file.

### Commatizer

This script replaces characters you specify with commas.

### Decommatizer 

This script removes commas in files you specify. (This is helpful if you want to turn a tab-separated .csv into a comma-seperated .csv but want to get rid of commas in text fields first.)

### FileCat

This script pastes together files you specify.

### To use

- If you don't already have it installed, download & install Python 3 (link: https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Download these scripts and place in the folder with the files you want to modify. 
- Open the command line and navigate to the same folder.
- Type "python commatizer.py" (replace commatizer.py with the name of the file you want to run) and hit enter
- Follow the prompts
- That's it! Your new files will be saved to your current directory.

IMPORTANT: these scripts are in Python 3. If you try to run them with Python 2 they won't work. To check what version of Python you're using, launch Python by typing "python" in the command line. The version number will be at the very top. To close Python, type "quit()" and hit enter.
